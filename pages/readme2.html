                    <p class="post-excerpt">Understanding the basics of allergies is essential for anyone looking to manage or avoid allergic reactions. Allergies occur when the immune system reacts to a substance (allergen) as if it were a threat. Here’s a primer on what allergies are, common types, and how to manage them.</p>

                        <h3>1. What Are Allergies?</h3>
                        <p>Allergies are hypersensitive responses from the immune system to substances that are typically harmless to most people. These substances, known as allergens, can trigger symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Common allergens include pollen, pet dander, and certain foods.</p>

                        <ul class="post-excerpt">
                            <li><strong>Seasonal Allergies</strong>: Often caused by pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds.</li>
                            <li><strong>Food Allergies</strong>: Reactions to specific foods such as peanuts, shellfish, and dairy.</li>

                            <li><strong>Insect Allergies</strong>: Reactions to stings or bites from insects like bees or mosquitoes.</li>

                        <h3>3. Symptoms of Allergies</h3>
                        <p>Allergy symptoms can vary widely depending on the allergen and the severity of the reaction. Common symptoms include sneezing, itching, runny nose, rashes, and swelling. In more severe cases, allergies can lead to anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening reaction that requires immediate medical attention.</p>

                        <p>Diagnosing allergies typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, and allergy testing. Tests may include skin prick tests, blood tests, or elimination diets to identify specific allergens.</p>

                        <p>Managing allergies involves avoiding known allergens and, if necessary, using medications or treatments prescribed by a healthcare professional. Over-the-counter antihistamines and decongestants can help alleviate mild symptoms, while allergy shots (immunotherapy) may be recommended for more severe cases.</p>
