                    <p class="blog-posts">Understanding the basics of allergies is essential for anyone looking to manage or avoid allergic reactions.

                        <h3>1. What Are Allergies?</h3>
                        <p>Allergies are hypersensitive responses from the immune system to substances that are typically harmless to most people. These substances, known as allergens, can trigger symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Common allergens include pollen, pet dander, and certain foods.</p>

                        <p>Allergy symptoms can vary widely depending on the allergen and the severity of the reaction. Common symptoms include sneezing, itching, runny nose, rashes, and swelling.
