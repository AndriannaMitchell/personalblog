                        <q>
                            In our increasingly health-conscious society, understanding common allergens has never been more crucial. Allergies can affect anyone, and knowing what to look out for can make a significant difference in managing your health and well-being. In this post, we’ll delve into some of the most common allergens and what makes them so problematic for many people.

                            <h2>1. Peanuts</h2>
                            <p>Peanuts are one of the most well-known allergens and can cause severe reactions, including anaphylaxis. They are commonly found in snacks, baked goods, and various sauces. It’s important to read labels carefully and be aware of cross-contamination.</p>

                            <p>Tree nuts, including almonds, walnuts, and cashews, are another common allergen. They are often used in baking and cooking and can be hidden in foods like granola bars and sauces. Symptoms can range from mild rashes to severe respiratory issues.</p>

                            <p>Lactose intolerance and dairy allergies are frequently confused, but they are distinct issues. Dairy allergies involve an immune response to proteins in milk, which can lead to symptoms such as hives, abdominal pain, and more serious reactions. Dairy is prevalent in many foods, making it essential for those with allergies to be vigilant.</p>

                            <p>Egg allergies are particularly common in children, though many outgrow them. Eggs are used in baking and cooking, and their proteins can trigger allergic reactions. Always check ingredient lists and be cautious with foods like mayonnaise and baked goods.</p>

                            <p>Wheat allergies are different from celiac disease, which involves gluten intolerance. Wheat allergies can cause symptoms such as itching, swelling, and digestive issues. With the rise of gluten-free products, managing a wheat allergy has become somewhat easier, but vigilance is still necessary.</p>
